# Rust in Gecko

In the media playback team we've been working on writing parser code in the new
rust programming language for safety. I'll talk about what this looks like, why
it's important, and how other contributors can try it too.

# Why

We don't know how to write safe, concurrent C++ code.

Media playback is cpu-intensive, must juggle many resources.

Seems ideal for thread parallelism, but we've had lots of
trouble with races, deadlocks, inefficiency.

---

# Why not?

We've been using the stagefright mp4 demuxer (from Android).
Found ~6 security vulnerabilities this year alone.

This is the problem rust was designed to solve.

# Add code

In moz.build:

```python
if CONFIG['MOZ_RUST']:
    SOURCES += ['hello.rs',]
    UNIFIED_SOURCES += ['TestRust.cpp',]
```

---

# Foreign Function Interface

Rust can target the C ABI. In C++ code declare:

```C
#ifdef MOZ_RUST
extern "C" uint8_t* test_rust();
#endif
```

In rust code implement:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern fn test_rust() -> *const u8 { ... }
```
